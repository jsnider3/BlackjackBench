## Thoughts

>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in at least 150 words. State the rules you assume, then describe your strategy.

Assumed rules

6-deck shoe, dealer peeks for blackjack and stands on soft 17 (S17)
Blackjack pays 3:2
Double on any two cards; double after split allowed (DAS)
Split up to 3–4 hands; split aces get one card each; no resplit aces
Late surrender available; no side bets
How I play

Table selection and bankroll
Prioritize 3:2 payout, S17, DAS, fewer decks; avoid 6:5 tables and side bets.
Set a session bankroll and flat-bet 0.5–1% per hand unless you’re counting.
2. Basic strategy (core rules)

Hard totals:
8 or less: hit
9: double vs 3–6, else hit
10: double vs 2–9, else hit
11: double vs 2–A
12: stand vs 4–6, else hit
13–16: stand vs 2–6, else hit
17+: stand
Soft totals (A counted as 11):
A,2–A,3: double vs 5–6, else hit
A,4–A,5: double vs 4–6, else hit
A,6: double vs 3–6, else hit
A,7: double vs 3–6; stand vs 2,7,8; hit vs 9–A
A,8/A,9: stand
Pairs:
Always split A,A and 8,8
Never split 5,5 or 10,10
2,2 and 3,3: split vs 2–7
4,4: split vs 5–6 (only if DAS), else hit
6,6: split vs 2–6
7,7: split vs 2–7
9,9: split vs 2–6 and 8–9; stand vs 7,10,A
3. Surrender and insurance

Surrender: 16 (not 8,8) vs 9,10,A; 15 vs 10.
Never take insurance/even money unless you’re counting (then only with a high true count, ~+3 or more).
4. Optional edge: simple card counting (Hi‑Lo)

Keep a running count: +1 for 2–6, 0 for 7–9, −1 for 10–A.
Convert to true count (running/decks remaining) to size bets: bet more when TC is high.
Key deviations (examples): take insurance at TC ≥ +3; stand 16 vs 10 at TC ≥ 0; stand 12 vs 3 at TC ≥ +2, 12 vs 2 at TC ≥ +3.
5. Etiquette/flow

Use hand signals, don’t touch cards in shoe games, place doubles/splits equal to your original bet, and keep side bets off.
With these rules and strict basic strategy, the house edge is roughly 0.3–0.5%. Counting can swing that to a small player edge.
