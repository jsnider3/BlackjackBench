## Thoughts

>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in at least 150 words. State the rules you assume, then describe your strategy.

**Rules I'm assuming:**
I'll assume standard casino blackjack rules: the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, beating the dealer's hand. Number cards are worth face value, face cards are worth 10, and aces are worth 1 or 11. Players receive two cards initially and can hit (take another card) or stand (keep current total). The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. Blackjack (ace + 10-value card) pays 3:2. Players can double down on their first two cards, split pairs, and may surrender in some variants.

**My strategy:**
I'd use basic strategy, which is mathematically optimal play based on your cards versus the dealer's upcard. Key principles include: always hit on hard totals under 12; stand on hard 17 or higher; hit soft 17 but stand on soft 18 against dealer's 9, 10, or ace. I'd double down on 11 against dealer's 2-10, and on 10 against dealer's 2-9. For pairs, I'd always split aces and 8s, never split 5s or 10s, and follow specific rules for other pairs based on dealer's upcard. I'd avoid insurance bets as they favor the house. This basic strategy reduces the house edge to around 0.5%, making it one of the most favorable casino games for players who stick to optimal play.
