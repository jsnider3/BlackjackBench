## Thoughts

>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in at least 150 words. State the rules you assume, then describe your strategy.

I'll explain blackjack based on standard casino rules and share an optimal strategy approach.

**Rules I'm assuming:**
- Goal is to get cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, Aces can be 1 or 11, other cards face value
- Dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17
- Player can hit, stand, double down, or split pairs
- Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) pays 3:2
- Regular wins pay 1:1
- Using standard 6-8 deck shoe

**My strategy would follow basic strategy:**
I'd use mathematically optimal decisions based on my cards versus the dealer's upcard. For example, I'd always hit on hard totals of 11 or less, stand on hard 17 or higher, and double down on 11 against dealer's 2-10. With soft hands (containing an Ace), I'd be more aggressive - doubling soft 13-18 against weak dealer upcards.

For pairs, I'd always split Aces and 8s, never split 5s or 10s, and split other pairs based on dealer's upcard. I'd avoid insurance bets as they have poor odds. This basic strategy reduces the house edge to around 0.5%, making it one of the better casino games for players who follow optimal play.
