## Thoughts

>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in at least 150 words. State the rules you assume, then describe your strategy.

I'll assume we're playing standard casino blackjack with these rules: dealer stands on soft 17, doubling allowed on any two cards, doubling after splitting allowed, surrender permitted, and using a standard 52-card deck where aces count as 1 or 11, face cards as 10, and number cards at face value. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

My strategy would follow basic strategy charts, which are mathematically optimal decisions based on your hand versus the dealer's upcard. Key principles include: always split aces and eights, never split tens or fives, and double down on 11 against dealer's 2-10. I'd hit on hard totals under 12, stand on hard 17 or higher, and be more aggressive against dealer's weak upcards (2-6) since they're more likely to bust.

For soft hands (containing an ace), I'd be more liberal with hitting and doubling since the ace provides protection against busting. I'd also consider surrender against dealer's strong upcards when holding terrible hands like hard 16 versus a 10. Card counting, while not cheating, would theoretically improve odds but requires significant practice and isn't practical in most modern casinos due to continuous shuffling machines and multiple decks.
