Rules of Blackjack I Assume
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino card game played with one or more standard 52-card decks (I assume a six-deck shoe, common in casinos). The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21 (busting). Card values are: numbered cards 2-10 are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and aces are worth 1 or 11 at the player's discretion (soft hands). A natural blackjack— an ace plus a 10-value card—pays 3:2 and wins immediately unless the dealer also has one (push). Players can hit (take another card), stand (keep current hand), double down (double bet and take one more card), split (if initial two cards are a pair, split into two hands), or sometimes surrender (forfeit half the bet, but I'll assume this isn't available). The dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more (I assume dealer hits on soft 17, as in many Vegas rules). Insurance bets against dealer blackjack are optional but not part of optimal play. The game proceeds with players acting first, then the dealer reveals their hole card.

My Strategy for Playing Blackjack
To play optimally and minimize the house edge (around 0.5% with perfect play), I follow basic strategy, derived from computer simulations of millions of hands. This isn't card counting (which requires tracking high/low cards and is advanced/risky in casinos) but a deterministic chart-based approach. I'd memorize or reference a basic strategy chart, which dictates actions based on my hand total and the dealer's upcard.

For hard hands (no ace or ace as 1): With 8 or less, always hit. With 9, double if dealer shows 3-6, else hit. With 10, double on dealer 2-9, else hit. With 11, double on 2-10, hit on ace. With 12, hit on dealer 2 or 3, stand on 4-6, hit on 7-ace. With 13-16, stand on dealer 2-6, hit otherwise. With 17+, always stand.

For soft hands (ace as 11): Soft 13-14, hit on dealer 5-6, else hit (or double on 5-6 if allowed). Soft 15-16, double on 4-6, else hit. Soft 17, double on 3-6, else hit. Soft 18, stand on 2-6/8, double on 3-6, hit on 7/9-ace. Soft 19+, stand.

For pairs: Always split aces and 8s. Split 2s/3s on dealer 2-7. Split 6s/7s on 2-7 (7s also on 2). Split 9s on 2-6/8-9. Never split 4s/5s/10s. For doubles and splits, I'd only do so if the rules allow (e.g., double after split).

In practice, I'd start with a bet within bankroll limits (e.g., 1-2% per hand to avoid ruin). I'd avoid side bets like insurance (house edge ~7%) and play at tables with favorable rules (stand on soft 17, 3:2 payout). If counting cards, I'd use Hi-Lo system (assign +1 to 2-6, -1 to 10-ace, 0 to 7-9; bet more when true count >2), but for casual play, stick to basic strategy. This approach has beaten the game in simulations, though variance means short-term losses are possible—discipline and bankroll management are key. Overall, blackjack is skill-influenced luck, making it engaging for strategic minds like mine.
