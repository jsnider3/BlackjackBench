# Opus 4.1 Thoughts

These are Opus 4.1's thoughts on blackjack

## Thoughts

>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in at least 150 words. State the rules you assume, then describe your strategy.

## Assumed Rules

I'll assume standard casino blackjack rules: 6-8 decks, dealer stands on soft 17, blackjack pays 3:2, double down allowed on any two cards, splitting allowed on pairs, and no surrender option. The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without busting.

## My Strategy

I'd follow basic strategy, which is mathematically optimal play based on your hand versus the dealer's upcard. Here are the key principles:

**Hard totals:** Stand on 17+. With 12-16, stand if the dealer shows 2-6 (they're likely to bust), but hit against 7-Ace. Always hit 11 or less.

**Soft hands:** Always hit or double soft 17 or less. Stand on soft 19-21. With soft 18, stand against 2-8 but hit against 9-Ace.

**Pairs:** Always split Aces and 8s. Never split 5s or 10s. Split 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, and 9s depending on the dealer's upcard.

**Doubling:** Double 11 against everything except a dealer Ace. Double 10 against 2-9. Double 9 against 3-6.

I'd avoid insurance bets (they're negative expected value) and side bets. I'd also maintain strict bankroll management, betting consistently rather than trying to "chase losses" or using betting systems like Martingale, which don't overcome the house edge.
