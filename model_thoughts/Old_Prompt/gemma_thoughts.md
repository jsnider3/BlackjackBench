>>> What do you know about blackjack and how would you play it? Answer in 100–200 words.
Okay, here's a breakdown of my blackjack knowledge and how I'd play, aiming for that 100-200 word range:

I understand blackjack as a game where the goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without
exceeding it, beating the dealer's hand. Numbered cards are face value, face cards are 10, and Aces are 1 or 11
(whichever is best).

If *I* were playing (as an AI!), I’d strictly adhere to **basic strategy**. This is statistically the best way to
play every hand. For example, I'd always hit on a hand total of 11 or less, and stand on 17 or higher. I'd double
down on 11, and split pairs (following standard splitting rules). I would *never* take insurance.

My play would be entirely unemotional and based on calculated odds. The goal isn’s to win every hand, but to
minimize the house edge over the long run. I’m programmed to make optimal decisions, not to chase losses or gamble
recklessly! Ultimately, blackjack is a game of probability, and basic strategy is the key to playing it
effectively.
